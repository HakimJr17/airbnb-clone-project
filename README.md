# Airbnb Clone Project  
## About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Team Roles
### A breakdown of the various roles required for a project like an Airbnb clone. I outlines what each position does and its importance in bringing a software product from an idea to a functional reality.
1. Business Analyst (BA): They figure out what the app needs to do from a business perspective. They'd define features like "users can search for listings" or "hosts can create a profile." They're the bridge between the business side and the technical team.

2. Product Owner (PO): This person is responsible for the overall vision of the product. They'd decide what features get prioritized and added to the app and in what order. They work closely with the Business Analyst and the development team.

3. Project Manager (PM): They ensure the project stays on track. They manage timelines, budgets, and team communication, making sure everyone knows what they're supposed to be doing and that deadlines are met.

4. UI/UX Designer: This is a crucial role for an app like Airbnb. The UI (User Interface) designer creates the look and feel of the app‚Äîthe buttons, colors, and layout. The UX (User Experience) designer focuses on how the app flows and feels to the user, making sure it's intuitive and easy to use.

5. Software Architect: This person designs the technical foundation of the app. They decide on the programming languages, databases, and overall structure to ensure the app is scalable, secure, and performant.

6. Software Developer: These are the people who write the code and build the application. On a project like this, you would likely have a mix of developers specializing in different areas, such as frontend (what the user sees) and backend (the server-side logic).

7. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: They test the app to find bugs and make sure it works as intended. They're all about quality control, ensuring the app is stable and reliable before it's released to users.

8. Test Automation Engineer: This is a specialized type of QA engineer who writes code to automatically test the application. This saves a lot of time and helps catch issues quickly as new features are added.

9. DevOps Engineer: They manage the infrastructure and tools for building, testing, and deploying the application. They're the ones who make sure the app is running smoothly on the servers and can be updated without issues.

## Technology Stack Overview
### Desription of the technologies to be used in the AirBnB clone project and their application 

### Backend and API Development
#### Django: 
This is the foundation of the project's backend. As a high-level Python web framework, its purpose is to provide a robust and efficient way to build the core logic of the Airbnb clone, including user authentication, listing management, and booking systems.

#### Django REST Framework (DRF): 
Built on top of Django, DRF's purpose is to make it easy to create the RESTful API. This API is what allows the different parts of the application‚Äîlike the frontend website or mobile app‚Äîto communicate with the backend database. It handles things like serializing data (converting database information into a format like JSON) and managing API endpoints.

#### PostgreSQL: 
The purpose of this powerful relational database is to reliably store all the structured data for the application. This would include user profiles, property listings, booking details, and reviews, ensuring data integrity and allowing for complex queries.

#### GraphQL: 
While a REST API is built with DRF, GraphQL would be used to provide a more flexible and efficient way for the client (frontend) to request data. Its purpose is to allow the frontend to ask for exactly the data it needs in a single request, which can reduce over-fetching and improve performance.

### Asynchronous Tasks and Caching
#### Celery: 
The purpose of Celery is to handle tasks that don't need to be completed immediately, keeping the user experience fast and responsive. For an Airbnb clone, it would manage asynchronous tasks such as sending booking confirmation emails, processing payment notifications, or generating reports in the background.

#### Redis: 
In this project, Redis serves two main purposes. It acts as a message broker for Celery, helping to queue and manage tasks. It is also used for caching, which involves temporarily storing frequently accessed data (like popular listings) in memory to reduce the number of database queries and speed up the application.

### DevOps and Deployment
#### Docker: 
The purpose of Docker is to containerize the application, packaging the code and all its dependencies into a consistent, isolated environment. This ensures that the application runs the same way on a developer's machine as it does on a production server, simplifying the development and deployment process.

#### CI/CD Pipelines: 
The purpose of these automated pipelines is to streamline the entire development workflow. CI (Continuous Integration) automatically tests new code changes to catch bugs early, while CD (Continuous Deployment) automatically deploys the tested code to production. This ensures that new features and bug fixes can be delivered to users quickly and reliably.

## Database Design
### Below are the key entities that represent the core data of the application. Here are these main entities and their relationships.

### Users üë•
This entity represents everyone on the platform, including both guests and hosts. A single user can act as both a guest (booking a property) and a host (listing a property).

1. id: A unique identifier for each user.

2. full_name: The user's name.

3. email: The user's email address, which must be unique.

4. password_hash: A secure, hashed version of the user's password.

4. role: An indicator (e.g., 'guest', 'host') to determine what actions the user can perform.

Relationship: A user can create many properties (one-to-many relationship) and a user can also make many bookings (one-to-many relationship).

### Properties üè°
This entity contains all the information about the listings that hosts offer.

1. id: A unique identifier for the property.

2. host_id: A foreign key that links the property to a specific user (the host).

3. title: The name of the listing.

4. description: A detailed summary of the property.

5. price_per_night: The cost to book the property for one night.

6. location: The address or geographic coordinates of the property.

Relationship: A property belongs to one user (the host), and a property can have many bookings associated with it.

### Bookings üìÖ
This entity records the details of each reservation made by a guest.

1. id: A unique identifier for the booking.

2. guest_id: A foreign key linking the booking to the user who made it.

3. property_id: A foreign key linking the booking to the specific property being reserved.

4. check_in_date: The date the guest's stay begins.

5. check_out_date: The date the guest's stay ends.

6. status: The current state of the booking (e.g., 'pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled').

Relationship: A booking belongs to one user (the guest) and one property. A property can have multiple bookings. A booking can also have one or more payments linked to it.

### Reviews ‚≠ê
This entity stores the feedback and ratings left by guests about a property or host.

1. id: A unique identifier for the review.

2. booking_id: A foreign key linking the review to a specific booking.

3. reviewer_id: A foreign key linking the review to the user who wrote it.

4. rating: A numerical score, typically on a scale from 1 to 5.

5. comment: The text of the review.

Relationship: A review is always tied to a single booking and is written by a single user.

### Payments üí≥
This entity handles all the transaction details for each booking.

1. id: A unique identifier for the payment.

2. booking_id: A foreign key that links the payment to a specific booking.

3. amount: The total cost of the booking.

4. status: The status of the payment (e.g., 'completed', 'pending', 'failed').

5. payment_date: The date and time the payment was made.

Relationship: A payment is linked to one booking. A booking can have a one-to-one relationship with a single payment, or if the system supports split payments, a one-to-many relationship.

### Photos üñºÔ∏è
This entity stores the images for each property.

1. id: A unique identifier for the photo.

2. property_id: A foreign key that links the photo to a specific property.

3. image_url: The URL or path to the stored image file.

4. is_main: A boolean field to indicate if this is the primary or "cover" photo for the listing.

5. caption: A short description of the photo (e.g., 'living room view').

Relationship: A property can have many photos (one-to-many relationship), but each photo belongs to only one property. This structure makes it easy to add, remove, and manage images for each listing.
